# Tic-Tac-Toe
First time using materials from classes for a project on the side. Coding was simple enough, but I am
learning to make the final product look cleaner. Still adding a few pieces to exclude invalid inputs
and adjust the look of the program in the console. This was built in Dev C++, so not everything that
was used will be supported in all compilers, but basic function should still be retained.
